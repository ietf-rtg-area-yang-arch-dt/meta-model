Open Issues: 

   1. Protocol specific policies have been moved under the protocols (e.g., BGP). Thoughts?
   2. Do we need specific RIB policy or is there only RIB client policy? One requirement could
      be FIB installation policy. We are assuming RIB client policy is in the client.
   3. The argument as to whether various models should be rooted at the
      logical-network-instance or networking-instance is an interesting one. For example,
      key-chain and network-services. Thoughts?  
   4. Need to revisit VRF policy definition and relationship to L3VPN Config/Policy.
   5. This model may not support the zone-based policy firewall - TBD to figure this out. 
      Any opinion? 
   6. Need to describe how logical-network-instance administrators can access all 
      interfaces assigned to logical-network-instance. An administrator with the 
      global-view must assign the respective interfaces to the logical-network-instance. 
      Systems that only support allocation of interfaces to VRFs (and not 
      logical-network-elements) will require assignment to specific VRFs rather than 
      instance as a whole.
   7. YANG model needed corresponding to the tree. 

Design Team Plans: 

   1. Finalize and document meta model
   2. Finalize Operational State recommendation 
   3. Revisit YANG recommendations
   4. Revisit YANG model conventions
