                Network Device YANG Organizational Model
                 draft-rtgyangdt-rtgwg-device-model-01

Abstract

   This document presents an approach for organizing YANG models in a
   comprehensive structure that defines how individual models may be
   composed to configure and operate network infrastructure and
   services.  The structure is itself represented as a YANG model,
   with all of the related component models logically
   organized in a way that is operationally intuitive. This document is
   derived from work submitted to the IETF by members of the informal
   OpenConfig working group of network operators and is a product of the
   Routing Area YANG Architecture design team.

1.  Introduction

   "Operational Structure and Organization of YANG Models" [OC-STRUCT],
   highlights the value of organizing individual, self-standing YANG
   [RFC6020] models into a more comprehensive structure.  This
   document builds on that work and presents a derivative structure for
   use in representing the networking infrastructure aspects of physical
   and virtual devices.  While [OC-STRUCT] and earlier versions of this
   document presented a single device-centeric model root, this document
   no longer contains this element.

   This document aims to provide an extensible structure that can be
   used to tie together other models. It allows for existing, emerging,
   and future models. The overall structure can be constructed using
   YANG augmentation and imports.

   Additional motivation for this work can be found in [OC-STRUCT].

   The approach taken in this (and the original) document is to organize
   the models describing various aspects of network infrastructure,
   focusing on devices, their subsystems, and relevant protocols
   operating at the link and network layers.  The proposal does not
   consider a common model for higher level network services, nor does
   it specify details of how hardware-related data should be organized.
   We focus on the set of models that are commonly used by network
   operators, and suggest a corresponding organization.

   A significant portion of the text and model contained in this
   document was taken from the -00 of [OC-STRUCT].

1.1.  Status of Work and Open Issues

   This version of the document and structure are a product of the
   Routing Area YANG Architecture design team and is very much a work in
   progress rather than a final proposal.  Recent discussions have been
   quite focused on the single device root, /device, that was in the -00
   version of this document and [OC-STRUCT].  Secondary discussions have
   focsued on representation of logical network elements. Disagreement
   and open issues remain, even within the design team.  Major open
   issues are as follows:

   1. The structure related to L2VPNs, Ethernet services, and virtual
      switching instances has not yet received sufficient discussion
      and is likely to change.

   2. Additional discussion and text is need to ensure that the
      interpretation of different policy containers is clear.

   3. Configuration information related to network-instance
      interconnection (over a "core" network) is currently commingled
      with configuration related to operation within the instance.

   4. The representation of operational state is currently missing.  The
      model will be updated once the "opstate" requirements are
      addressed.

   5. Interface logical network element id and logical networking
      instance name augmentations are currently defined within the
      context of network-device.  It may clearer to define these each
      in their own modules.

   6. There is a proposal on the table to support logical network
      elements using an enhanced version of [NETMOD-MOUNT].  The authors
      and design team are open to this proposal and are interested in
      discussiong this options as speific details are available.

2.  Module Overview

   In this document we consider network devices that support protocols
   and functions defined within the IETF Routing Area, e.g, routers,
   firewalls and hosts. Such devices may be physical or virtual, e.g., a
   classic router with custom hardware or one residing within a
   server-based virtual machine implementing a virtual network function
   (VNF). Each device may sub-divide their resources into logical
   network elements (LNEs) each of which provides a managed logical
   device.  Examples of vendor terminology for an LNE include logical
   system or router, and virtual switch, chassis, or fabric. Each LNE
   may also support virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) and virtual
   switching instance (VSI) functions, which are referred to below as a
   networking instances (NI). This breakdown is represented in Figure 1.
   A model for LNEs is described in Section 2.2 and the sub-model for
   networking instances is covered in Section 2.2.2.

                 Figure 1: Module Element Relationships

   The presented module can itself be thought of as a "meta-model" as it
   describes the relationships between individual models.  We choose to
   represent it also as simple YANG module consisting of models, lists
   and containers to serve as anchor points for the corresponding
   individual models.

   The module does not follow the hierarchy of any particular
   implementation, and hence is vendor-neutral.  Nevertheless, the
   structure should be familiar to network operators and also readily
   mapped to vendor implementations. The overall structure is:

     module: network-device
        +--rw info
        |  +--rw device-type?   enumeration
        +--rw hardware
        +--rw qos
        +--rw logical-network-elements
        |     ...
     augment /if:interfaces/if:interface: 
              ...
 
   The top level models generally represent resources that are
   associated with a device that can themselves be assigned to LNEs.
   Notably, the existing Interface Management model [RFC7223] is also
   included at the top level, although it is augmented to allow for
   LNEs.  An info section is included for basic device information such
   as its type (e.g., physical or virtual), vendor, model, etc. The
   hardware section is a placeholder for device-specific configuration
   and operational state data.  For example, a common structure for the
   hardware model might include chassis, line cards, and ports, but we
   leave this unspecified. The Quality of Service (qos) section is a
   placeholder for device-wide configuration and operational state data
   which relates to the treatment of traffic across the device.

2.1.  Interface Model Components

   Interfaces are a crucial part of any network device's configuration
   and operational state.  They generally include a combination of raw
   physical interfaces, link-layer interfaces, addressing configuration,
   and logical interfaces that may not be tied to any physical
   interface.  Several system services, and layer 2 and layer 3
   protocols may also associate configuration or operational state data
   with different types of interfaces (these relationships are not shown
   for simplicity).  

   This document augments the existing Interface Management model
   [RFC7223] in two ways.  The first is add an identifier which is used
   on physical interface types, as defined by [RFC7224], to identify an
   associated LNE. The second is to add a name which is used on
   sub-interface types to identify an associated networking instance.
   Similarly, this name is also added for IPv4 and IPv6 types, as
   defined in [RFC7277].

   The interface related definitions are as follows:
   
      augment /if:interfaces/if:interface:
         +--rw bind-network-element-id?         uint8
      augment /if:interfaces/if:interface:
         +--rw bind-networking-instance-name?   string
      augment /if:interfaces/if:interface/ip:ipv4:
         +--rw bind-networking-instance-name?   string
      augment /if:interfaces/if:interface/ip:ipv6:
         +--rw bind-networking-instance-name?   string

   The following is an example of envisioned usage.  The interfaces
   container includes a number of commonly used components as examples:

          +--rw interfaces
          |  +--rw interface* [name]
          |     +--rw name                       string
          |     +--rw bind-network-element-id?   uint8
          |     +--rw ethernet
          |     |  +--rw bind-networking-instance-name?   string
          |     |  +--rw aggregates
          |     |  +--rw rstp
          |     |  +--rw lldp
          |     |  +--rw ptp
          |     +--rw vlans
          |     +--rw tunnels
          |     +--rw ipv4
          |     |  +--rw bind-networking-instance-name?   string
          |     |  +--rw arp
          |     |  +--rw icmp
          |     |  +--rw vrrp
          |     |  +--rw dhcp-client
          |     +--rw ipv6
          |        +--rw bind-networking-instance-name?   string
          |        +--rw vrrp
          |        +--rw icmpv6
          |        +--rw nd
          |        +--rw dhcpv6-client

   The bind-networking-instance-name leaf is an explicit and notable
   addition.  The [RFC7223] defined interface model is structured to
   include all interfaces in a flat list, without regard to logical or
   virtual instances (e.g., VRFs) supported on the device.  The
   bind-networking-instance-name leaf provides the association between
   an interface and its associated networking instance (e.g., VRF or
   VSI).

2.2.  Logical Network Elements

   Logical network elements represent the capability on some devices to
   partition resources into independent logical routers and/or switches.
   Device support for multiple logical network elements is
   implementation specific.  Systems without such capabilities will have
   just a single container.  In physical devices, some hardware features
   are shared across partitions, but control plane (e.g., routing)
   protocol instances, tables, and configuration are managed separately.
   For example, in virtual routers or VNFs, this may correspond to
   establishing multiple logical instances using a single software
   installation.  The model supports configuration of multiple instances
   on a single device by creating a list of logical network elements,
   each with their own configuration and operational state related to
   routing and switching protocols, as shown below:

     module: network-device
          +--rw logical-network-elements
             +--rw logical-network-element* [network-element-id]
                +--rw network-element-id                  uint8
                +--rw network-element-name?               string
                +--rw default-networking-instance-name?   string
                +--rw system-management
                |  ...
                +--rw ietf-acl
                +--rw ietf-key-chain
                +--rw networking-instances
                |  ...

   Network-element-id and network-element-name identify the logical
   network element.

   Default-networking-instance-name identifies the networking instance
   to use for system management connectivity.  Other instances may
   access system management function through appropriate inter-instance
   configuration.

2.2.1.  System Management

   The model supports the potentially independent system management
   functions and configuration per logical network element. This
   permits, for example, different users to manage either the whole
   device or just the associated logical network element.  System
   management is supported by the system-management container which is
   expected to reuse definitions contained in [RFC7317] and is shown
   below:

     module: network-device
        +--rw logical-network-elements
           +--rw logical-network-element* [network-element-id]
              +--rw system-management
                 +--rw device-view?                  boolean
                 +--rw system-management-global
                 +--rw system-management-protocol* [type]
                    +--rw type    identityref

   The device-view leaf is used to indicate if the system management
   functions associated with the logical network element are restricted
   to the logical network element or can manage the whole device.  The
   leaf may have a fixed value.  For example, some implementations may
   only support management on a device-wide basis.  Additional
   information on the implications of this leaf can be found in Section
   2.3.

   System-management-global is used for configuration information and
   state that is independent of a particular management protocol.
   System-management-protocol is a list of management protocol specific
   elements.  The type-specific sub-modules are expected to be defined. 

   The following is an example of envisioned usage:

     module: network-device
          +--rw logical-network-elements
                +--rw system-management
                   +--rw device-view?                      boolean
                   +--rw system-management-global
                   |  +--rw statistics-collection
                   |  ...
                   +--rw system-management-protocol* [type]
                   |  +--rw syslog
                   |  +--rw dns
                   |  +--rw ntp
                   |  +--rw ssh
                   |  +--rw tacacs
                   |  +--rw snmp
                   |  +--rw netconf

2.2.2.  Network Instances

   The network instance container is used to represent virtual routing
   and forwarding instances (VRFs) and virtual switching instances
   (VSIs), [RFC4026].  VRFs and VSIs are commonly used to isolate
   routing and switching domains, for example to create virtual private
   networks, each with their own active protocols and routing/switching
   policies.  The model represents both core/provider and virtual
   instances.  Network instances reuse and build on [RTG-CFG] and are
   shown below:

     module: network-device
          +--rw logical-network-elements
                +--rw networking-instances
                   +--rw networking-instance* [networking-instance-name]
                      +--rw networking-instance-name    string
                      +--rw type?                       identityref
                      +--rw enabled?                    boolean
                      +--rw router-id?                  uint32
                      +--rw description?                string
                      +--rw oam-protocols
                      |  ...
                      +--rw networking-instance-policy
                      |  ...
                      +--rw control-plane-protocols
                      |  ...
                      +--rw ribs
                      |  ...
                      +--rw mpls
                      |  ...
                      +--rw networking-services
                          ...

  [Editor's note: L2/MAC forwarding table is TBD]

2.2.2.1.  OAM Protocols

   OAM protocols that may run within the context of a network instance
   are grouped. The type identifyref is used to identify the information
   and state that may relate to a specific OAM protocol. The defined
   structure is as follows:

     module: network-device
          +--rw logical-network-elements
                +--rw networking-instances
                   +--rw networking-instance* [networking-instance-name]
                      +--rw oam-protocols
                         +--rw oam-protocol* [type]
                            +--rw type    identityref

   The following is an example of envisioned usage.  Examples shown
   below include Bi-directional Forwarding Detection (BFD), Ethernet
   Connectivity Fault Management (CFM), and Two-Way Active Measurement
   Protocol (TWAMP):

     module: network-device
          +--rw logical-network-elements
                +--rw networking-instances
                   +--rw networking-instance* [networking-instance-name]
                      +--rw oam-protocols
                         +--rw oam-protocol* [type]
                            +--rw bfd
                            +--rw cfm
                            +--rw twamp

2.2.2.2.  Network Instance Policy

   Network instance policies are used to control provider instances, VRF
   routing policies, and VRF/VSI identifiers. Examples include BGP route
   targets (RTs) and route distinguishers (RDs), if the instances is a
   core/provider instance, virtual network identifiers(VN-IDs), VPLS
   neighbors, etc. The structure is:

   The following is an example of envisioned usage:

     module: network-device
          +--rw logical-network-elements
                +--rw networking-instances
                   +--rw networking-instance* [networking-instance-name]
                      +--rw networking-instance-policy
                        (TBD)

2.2.2.3.  Control Plane Protocols

   Control plane protocols that may run within the context of a network
   instance are grouped. Each protocol is expected to have its own
   model, which is indicated by the type identityref. Protocol specific
   policy is included with the protocol rather than being combined in a
   separate generic policy grouping. The rationale behind this is that
   this ensures that only protocol relevant policies may be configured.
   A reusable or common approach may still be leveraged in creating
   these policy groupings, perhaps based on [RTG-POLICY]. The defined
   structure is as follows:

     module: network-device

   The following is an example of envisioned usage:

                             +--rw static-routes

2.2.2.4.  RIBs

   Every routing instance manages one or more routing information bases
   (RIB).  A RIB is a list of routes complemented with administrative
   data. RIBs reuse and build on [RTG-CFG] and are shown below:

     module: network-device
          +--rw logical-network-elements
                +--rw networking-instances
                   +--rw networking-instance* [networking-instance-name]
                      +--rw ribs
                         +--rw rib* [name]
                            +--rw name           string
                            +--rw description?   string
                            +--rw policy

2.2.2.5.  MPLS

    MPLS data plane related information is grouped together. MPLS
    control plane protocols are included above.  MPLS may reuse and
    build on [OC-MPLS] or other emerging models and is shown below:

     module: network-device
          +--rw logical-network-elements
                +--rw networking-instances
                   +--rw networking-instance* [networking-instance-name]
                      +--rw mpls
                         +--rw global
                         +--rw label-switched-paths
                         +--rw constrained-path
                         +--rw igp-congruent
                         +--rw static

2.2.2.6.  Networking Services

  A device may provide services to other devices within the scope of a
  networking instance.  The type identifyref is used to identify the
  service specific configuration and state information. The defined
  structure is as follows:

     module: network-device
          +--rw logical-network-elements
                +--rw networking-instances
                   +--rw networking-instance* [networking-instance-name]
                      +--rw networking-services
			+--rw networking-service* [type]
			   +--rw type    identityref


  The following is an example of envisioned usage: Examples shown below
  include a device-based Network Time Protocol (NTP) server, a Domain
  Name System (DNS) server, and a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
  (DHCP) server:

     module: network-device
          +--rw logical-network-elements
                +--rw networking-instances
                   +--rw networking-instance* [networking-instance-name]
                      +--rw networking-services
			 +--rw networking-service* [type]
                            +--rw ntp-server
                            +--rw dns-server
                            +--rw dhcp-server

2.3.  Device View vs Logical Network Element (LNE) View Management

   [Editor's note: an alternate approach based on a future enhanced
    version of [NETMOD-MOUNT] has been proposed and is being considered.
    This section would be replaced if such an alternate approach is
    followed. ]

   On some devices it is possible to limit control and management to a
   scoped set of system resources.  As stated above in Section 2.2., the
   documented approach supports this capability using logical network
   elements and the system management device-view leaf.

   When the device-view leaf is set to true, information accessible via
   a logical network element's system management functions represents
   the complete device.  This applies to all system management
   functions, not just those represented in the YANG model.  When
   viewing information represented in a YANG model, the device model
   will cover the full device and allow management across all logical
   network elements.

   The case when a logical network element's system management functions
   do not have a device wide view is more complex.  In this case, there
   are two perspectives: one from functions that are operating within a
   context of a logical network element that has a device wide view (or
   more simply have a "device view"); and the other from functions that
   are operating within a context of a logical network element that has
   only a logical network element view (or more simply have an "LNE
   view").

   From a management function operating with a device view, the
   limited logical network element's system management device-view
   leaf is simply set to false.

   Management functions operating with an LNE view can only see
   information (e.g., resources, interfaces, configuration, operational
   state, etc.) associated with in the logical network element.  When
   viewing information represented in a YANG model, a full device model
   (as defined in this document) is available from within the view, but
   it includes only those elements associated with the LNE.  For
   information contained with the logical-network-element container
   entry, this is the same information as available in a device wide
   view.  Information outside the logical-network-elements container is
   made available within an LNE view as is appropriated based on device
   wide configuration.  For example, interfaces assigned to the logical
   network element can be managed from within the LNE view.  Note: some
   information that can be modified from a device view may be read-only
   from within the LNE view.

   Multiple implementation approaches are possible to provide LNE views,
   and these are outside the scope of this document.

3.  Populating the structural model

   The structural model in this document describes how individual YANG
   models may be used together to represent the configuration and
   operational state for all parts of a physical or virtual device.  It
   does not, however, document the actual model in its entirety.  In
   this section, we outline an option for creating the full model and
   also describe how it may be used.

3.1.  Constructing the device model

   One of the challenges in assembling existing YANG models is that they
   are generally written with the assumption that each model is at the
   root of the configuration or state tree.  Combining models then
   results in a multi-rooted tree that does not follow any logical
   construction and makes it difficult to work with operationally.  In
   some cases, models explicitly reference other models (e.g., via
   augmentation) to define a relationship, but this is the case for only
   a few existing models.

   Some examples include the interfaces [RFC7223] and IP management
   [RFC7277] models, and proposed IS-IS [RTG-ISIS], OSPF [RTG-OSPF] and
   routing configuration [RTG-CFG] models.

3.2.  "Pull" approach for model composition

   To enable model composition, one possible approach is to avoid using
   root-level containers in individual component models.  Instead, the
   top level container (and all other data definitions) can be enclosed
   in a YANG 'grouping' statement so that when the model is imported by
   another model, its location in the configuration tree can be
   controlled by the importing YANG module with the 'uses' statement.
   One advantage of this approach is that the importing module has the
   flexibility to readily use the data definitions where the author
   deems appropriate.

   One obvious drawback is that individual models no longer contain any
   of their own data definitions and must be used by a higher-level
   model for their data nodes to become active.  Some judgment as to
   which models are more suited for inclusion in higher level models is
   also necessary to decide when the corresponding YANG module should
   contain only groupings.  Another potential drawback is that this
   approach does not define a common structure for models to fit
   together, limiting interoperability due to implementations using
   different structures.  To address this, a top-level standard model
   structure could be defined and updated to import new models into the
   hierarchy as they are defined.

3.3.  "Push" approach for model composition

   An alternative approach is to develop a top level model which defines
   the overall structure of the models, similar to the structure
   described in Section 2.  Individual models may augment the top level
   model with their data nodes in the appropriate locations.  The
   drawback is the need for a pre-defined top level model structure.  On
   the other hand, when this top level model is standardized, it can
   become the basis for a vendor-neutral way to manage devices, assuming
   that the component models are supported by a given implementation.

   One question in both approaches is what the root of the top-level
   model should be.  In this document we selected to base the model at a
   device because this layer should be common across many use cases and
   implementations.  Starting at a higher layer (e.g., services) makes
   defining and agreeing on a common organization more challenging as
   discussed in Section 1.1.

   Ideally, one could consider a hybrid construction mechanism that
   supports both styles of model composition.  For example, a YANG
   compiler or preprocessing directive could be used to indicate whether
   an individual model should assume it is at the root, or whether it is
   meant for inclusion in other higher-level models.

4.  Security Considerations

   The model structure described in this document does not define actual
   configuration and state data, hence it is not directly responsible
   for security risks.

   However, each of the component models that provide the corresponding
   configuration and state data should be considered sensitive from a
   security standpoint since they generally manipulate aspects of
   network configurations.  Each component model should be carefully
   evaluated to determine its security risks, along with mitigations to
   reduce such risks.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This YANG model currently uses a temporary ad-hoc namespace.  If it
   is placed or redirected for the standards track, an appropriate
   namespace URI will be registered in the "IETF XML Registry"
   [RFC3688].  The YANG structure modules will be registered in the
   "YANG Module Names" registry [RFC6020].

6.  YANG module

   The model structure is described by the YANG module below.
