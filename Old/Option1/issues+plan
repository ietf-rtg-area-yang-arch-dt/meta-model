Open Issues: 

   o  The structure related to L2VPNs, Ethernet services, and virtual
      switching instances has not yet received sufficient discussion
      and is likely to change.

   o  Additional discussion and text is need to ensure that the
      interpretation of different policy containers is clear.

   o  Configuration information related to network-instanced
      interconnection (over a "core" network) is currently commingled
      with configuration of related to operation within the instance.

   o  The representation of operational state is currently missing.  The
      model will be updated once the "opstate" discussion is resolved.

   o  the description of network-instance policy needs to be broadened to
      include VSI

   o  Need to revisit values of networking-instance type to ensure all
      VRF+VSI+Core types are represented 

   o  Need to revisit VRF policy definition and relationship to L3VPN Config/Policy.

   o  This model may not support the zone-based policy firewall - TBD to figure this out. 
      Any opinion? 

   o Is this too small
        leaf network-element-id {
          type uint8; // expect a small number of logical routers
          description "Device-wide unique identifier for the
                       logical network element";
        }

Design Team Plans: 

   1. Finalize and document meta model
   2. Finalize Operational State recommendation 
   3. Revisit YANG recommendations
   4. Revisit YANG model conventions

Old issues with resolutions:

    o Do we need specific RIB policy or is there only RIB client policy? One requirement could
      be FIB installation policy. We are assuming RIB client policy is in the client.
      
      <Yes>

   o  Protocol specific policies have been moved under the protocols (e.g., BGP). Thoughts?
      <discussed, and reflected in current model>

   o  The argument as to whether various models should be rooted at the
      logical-network-instance or networking-instance is an interesting one. For example,
      key-chain and network-services. Thoughts?  

      <discussed, and reflected in current model>

   o  YANG model needed corresponding to the tree. 
   
      <done>

   o  Need to describe how logical-network-instance administrators can access all 
      interfaces assigned to logical-network-instance. An administrator with the 
      global-view must assign the respective interfaces to the logical-network-instance. 
      Systems that only support allocation of interfaces to VRFs (and not 
      logical-network-elements) will require assignment to specific VRFs rather than 
      instance as a whole.

      <in -00 of DT meta model draft>

   o  Can we drop common-policy-objects?
      <Yes>


   o - We need to agree on where RTs are configured

       <network-instance-policy for now>

   o - We need to agree on core/provider instance are configured
       <type - details are still open>

-----

  o Do interface logical network element-id and logical networking
    instance name each need their own models or keep within
    model-structure?
