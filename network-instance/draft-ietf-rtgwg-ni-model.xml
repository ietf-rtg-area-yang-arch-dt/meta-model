  This document defines a network instance module. This module
  can be used to manage the
  virtual resource partitioning that may be present on a
  network device. Examples of
  common industry terms for virtual resource partitioning are Virtual
  Routing and Forwarding (VRF) instances and Virtual Switch Instances
  (VSIs).

<section anchor="sec-1" title="Introduction">
<t>
   This document defines the second of two new modules that are defined
   to support the configuration and operation of network-devices that
   allow for the partitioning of resources from both, or either,
   management and networking perspectives.  Both leverage the
   YANG functionality enabled by YANG Schema Mount <xref
   target="I-D.ietf-netmod-schema-mount"/>.
</t>
<t>
   The first form of resource partitioning
   provides a logical partitioning of a network device where each
   partition is separately managed as essentially an independent
   network element which is 'hosted' by the base network device.
   These hosted network elements are referred to as logical
   network elements, or LNEs, and are supported by the
   logical-network-element module defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-rtgwg-lne-model"/>.
   That module is used to identify LNEs and associate resources from the
   network-device with each LNE.  LNEs themselves are represented
   in YANG as independent network devices; each accessed
   independently.
   Examples of vendor terminology for an LNE include logical
   system or logical router, and virtual switch, chassis, or fabric.
</t>
<t>
   The second form, which is defined in this document, provides
   support for what is commonly referred to as Virtual Routing and
   Forwarding (VRF) instances as well as Virtual Switch Instances
   (VSI), see <xref target="RFC4026"/> and <xref target="RFC4664"/>.  In this form of resource
   partitioning, multiple control plane and forwarding/bridging
   instances are provided by and managed via a single (physical or
   logical) network device.  This form of resource partitioning is
   referred to as a Network Instance and is supported by the
   network-instance module defined below.  Configuration and
   operation of each network-instance is always via the network
   device and the network-instance module.
</t>
<t>
   One notable difference between the LNE model and the NI
   model is that the NI model provides a framework for VRF and VSI
   management.  This document envisions the separate definition of VRF
   and VSI, i.e., L3 and L2 VPN, technology specific models.  An example
   of such can be found in the emerging L3VPN model defined in <xref
   target="I-D.ietf-bess-l3vpn-yang"/> and the examples discussed below.

The top open issues are:
  <list style="numbers">
    <t>
      Schema mount currently doesn't allow parent-reference filtering on
      the instance of the mount point, but rather just the schema.  This
      means it is not possible to filter based on actual data, e.g.,
      bind-network-instance-name="green".  In the schema mount
      definition, the text and examples should be updated to cover this
      case.

   In this document, we consider network devices that support protocols
   and functions defined within the IETF Routing Area, e.g, routers,
   firewalls, and hosts. Such devices may be physical or virtual, e.g., a
   classic router with custom hardware or one residing within a
   server-based virtual machine implementing a virtual network function
   (VNF). Each device may sub-divide their resources into logical
   network elements (LNEs) each of which provides a managed logical
   device.  Examples of vendor terminology for an LNE include logical
   system or logical router, and virtual switch, chassis, or fabric. Each
   LNE may also support virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) and virtual
   switching instance (VSI) functions, which are referred to below as a
   network instances (NIs). This breakdown is represented in
   Figure 1.

   A model for LNEs is described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-rtgwg-lne-model"/> and
   the model for NIs is covered in this document in <xref
   target="sec-NI"/>.
</t>
<t>
   The current interface management model <xref target="RFC7223"/>
   is impacted by the definition of LNEs and
   NIs.  This document and <xref target="I-D.ietf-rtgwg-lne-model"/>
   define augmentations to the interface module to support LNEs
   and NIs.
</t>
<t>
  The network instance model supports the configuration of VRFs and
  VSIs.  Each instance is supported by information that relates to the
  device, for example the route target used when advertising VRF routes
  via the mechanisms defined in <xref target="RFC4364"/>, and
  information that relates to the internal operation of the NI, for
  example for routing protocols <xref target="RFC8022"/> and OSPF <xref
  target="I-D.ietf-ospf-yang"/>.  This document defines the
  network-instance module that provides a basis for the management of
  both types of information.
</t>
<t>
  NI information that relates to the device, including the assignment of
  interfaces to NIs, is defined as part of this document. The defined
  module also provides a placeholder for the definition of NI-technology
  specific information both at the device level and for NI internal
  operation.  Information related to NI internal operation is supported
  via schema mount <xref target="I-D.ietf-netmod-schema-mount"/> and
  mounting appropriate modules under the mount point.  Well known mount 
  points are defined for L3VPN, L2VPN, and L2+L3VPN NI types.

   The network instance container is used to represent virtual routing
   and forwarding instances (VRFs) and virtual switching instances
   (VSIs).  VRFs and VSIs are commonly used to isolate
   routing and switching domains, for example to create virtual private
   networks, each with their own active protocols and routing/switching
   policies.  The model supports both core/provider and virtual
   instances.  Core/provider instance information is accessible at the
   top level of the server, while virtual instance information is
   accessible under the root schema mount points.

   A network instance is identified by a
   'name' string.  This string is used both as
   an index within the network-instance module and to associate
   resources with a network instance as shown above in the
   interface augmentation. The ni-type and root-type choice statements are used to 
   support different types of L2 and L3 VPN technologies.
   The bind-ni-name-failed notification is used in certain failure cases.
</t>

<section anchor="sec-2.nit" title="NI Types and Mount Points">
  <t>
    The network-instance module is structured to facilitate the
    definition of information models for specific types of VRFs and VSIs
    using augmentations.  For example, the information needed to support
    VPLS, VxLAN and EVPN based L2VPNs are likely to be quite different.
    Example models under development that could be restructured to take
    advantage on NIs include, for L3VPNs <xref
    target="I-D.ietf-bess-l3vpn-yang"/> and for L2VPNs <xref
    target="I-D.ietf-bess-l2vpn-yang"/>.
  </t>
  <t>
    Documents defining new YANG models for the support of specific types
    of network instances should augment the network instance module.
    The basic structure that should be used for such augmentations
    include a case statement, with containers for configuration and
    state data and finally, when needed, a type specific mount point.
    Generally ni types, are expected to not need to define type specific
    mount points, but rather reuse one of the well known mount point, as
    defined in the next section. The following is an example type
    specific augmentation:
  </t>
  <t>
    <figure>
      <artwork>
 augment "/ni:network-instances/ni:network-instance/ni:ni-type" {
   case l3vpn {
     container l3vpn {
         ...
     }
     container l3vpn-state {
         ...
     }
   }
 }
      </artwork>
    </figure>
  </t>
  <section anchor="sec-2.nit.stdt" title="Well Known Mount Points">
    <t>
      YANG Schema Mount, <xref target="I-D.ietf-netmod-schema-mount"/>,
      identifies mount points by name within a module.  This definition
      allows for the definition of mount points whose schema can be
      shared across ni-types. As discussed above, ni-types largely
      differ in the configuration information needed in the core/top
      level instance to support the NI, rather than in the information
      represented within an NI.  This allows the use of shared mount
      points across certain NI types.
    </t>
    <t>
      The expectation is that there are actually very few different
      schema that need to be defined to support NIs on an
      implementation. In particular, it is expected that the following
      three forms of NI schema are needed, and each can be defined with
      a well known mount point that can be reused by future modules
      defining ni-types.
    </t>
    <t>
      The three well known mount points are:
      <list style="hanging">
        <t hangText="vrf-root"><vspace blankLines="0"/>
        vrf-root is intended for use with L3VPN type ni-types.
        </t>
        <t hangText="vsi-root"><vspace blankLines="0"/>
        vsi-root is intended for use with L2VPN type ni-types.
        </t>
        <t hangText="vv-root"><vspace blankLines="0"/>
        vv-root is intended for use with ni-types that simultaneously
        support L2VPN bridging and L3VPN routing capabilities.
        </t>
      </list>
    </t>
    <t>
      Future model definitions should use the above mount points
      whenever possible.  When a well known mount point isn't
      appropriate, a model may define a type specific mount point via
      augmentation.

   Interfaces are a crucial part of any network device's
   configuration and operational state.  They generally include a
   combination of raw physical interfaces, link-layer interfaces,
   addressing configuration, and logical interfaces that may not
   be tied to any physical interface.  Several system services,
   and layer 2 and layer 3 protocols may also associate
   configuration or operational state data with different types of
   interfaces (these relationships are not shown for simplicity).
   The interface management model is defined by <xref
   target="RFC7223"/>.
</t>
<t>
   As shown below, the network-instance module augments the existing
   interface management model by adding a name which is used on
   interface or sub-interface types to identify an associated network
   instance.  Similarly, this name is also added for IPv4 and IPv6
   types, as defined in <xref target="RFC7277"/>.

   The <xref target="RFC7223"/> defined interface model is
   structured to include all interfaces in a flat list, without
   regard to virtual instances (e.g., VRFs) supported
   on the device.  The
   bind-network-instance-name leaf provides the association
   between an interface and its associated NI (e.g., VRF
   or VSI).  Note that as currently
   defined, to assign an interface to both an LNE and NI, the interface
   would first be assigned to the LNE using the mechanisms defined in
   <xref target="I-D.ietf-rtgwg-lne-model"/>
   and then within that LNE's interface module, the LNE's representation
   of that interface would be assigned to an NI.

  Module data identified under "schema" will be instantiated under the
  mount point identified under "mount-point".  These modules will be
  able to reference information for nodes belonging to top-level modules
  that are identified under "parent-reference".  Parent referenced
  information is available to clients via their top level paths only,
  and not under the associated mount point.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="sec-NI.3" title="  Network Instance Instantiation">
  <t>
    Network instances may be controlled by clients using existing list
    operations.  When a list entry is created, a new instance is
    instantiated. The models mounted under an NI root are expected to be
    dependent on the server implementation.  When a list entry is
    deleted, an existing network instance is destroyed. For more
    information, see <xref target="RFC7950"/> Section 7.8.6.
  </t>
  <t>
    Once instantiated, host network device resources can be
    associated with the new NI.  As previously mentioned, this
    document augments ietf-interfaces with the bind-ni-name leaf
    to support such associations for interfaces.  When a
    bind-ni-name is set to a valid NI name, an implementation
    MUST take whatever steps are internally necessary to assign
    the interface to the NI or provide an error message (defined
    below) with an indication of why the assignment failed.  It is
    possible for the assignment to fail while processing the 
    set operation, or after asynchronous processing.  Error 
    notification in the latter case is supported via a notification.
  </t>
</section>
</section>
<section anchor="sec-4" title="Security Considerations">
  <t>
    There are two different sets of security considerations to consider
    in the context of this document.  One set is security related to
    information contained within mounted modules.  The security
    considerations for mounted modules are not substantively changed
    based on the information being accessible within the context of an
    NI.  For example, when considering the modules defined in <xref
    target="RFC8022"/>, the security considerations identified in that
    document are equally applicable, whether those modules are accessed
    at a server's root or under an NI instance's root node.
  </t>
  <t>
    The second area for consideration is information contained in the NI
    module itself.  NI information represents network configuration and
    route distribution policy information. As such, the security of this
    information is important, but it is fundamentally no different than
    any other interface or routing configuration information that has
    already been covered in <xref target="RFC7223"/> and <xref
    target="RFC8022"/>.
  </t>
  <t>The vulnerable "config true" parameters and subtrees are the
  following:
  <list style="hanging">
    <t hangText="/network-instances/network-instance:">
      This list specifies the network instances and the related control
      plane protocols configured on a device.
    </t>
    <t hangText="/if:interfaces/if:interface/*/bind-network-instance-name:">
      This leaf indicates the NI instance to which an interface is
      assigned.
    </t>
  </list>
  Unauthorized access to any of these lists can adversely affect the
  routing subsystem of both the local device and the network. This
  may lead to network malfunctions, delivery of packets to
  inappropriate destinations and other problems.
